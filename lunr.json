What is the entry? Entries are used to save information, you can understand it as a note or information. How to create an entry? You can create an entry by manually entering the link address of the web page and the corresponding content of the web link will be automatically saved to the entry You can also use the share button on the iOS system to add entries directly The above two methods, you can see how to add entries The composition of the entry Each entry consists of three parts, the title, notes, and link addresses. The title is automatically retrieved from the webpage when the entry is added, and we will attempt to get the webpage summary. If it is retrieved, it is pre-stored in the notebook. Like the notes, the title can be freely changed afterward. Follow-up version of the entry will allow to add more content, including but not limited to pictures, audio, video, etc., so stay tuned. Use tag management entries The application manages the entry by tagging the entry, and you can add multiple tags to the entry the way you like it. For example, make it easier for you to understand. if you have a habit of reading later, you can create a “read later” tag and add it to the entry you want to see later. When you want to read, just look at the tag entries can be. You can also add “Articles”, “Music”, “Video” and other tags to the entries according to the content of the entries, and add “1 star”, “2 star”, and “3 star” tags according to your own preference. Applications provide only basic and flexible tag usage, depending on how exactly you are using your imagination. How to manage tags Tags allow for the efficient management of entries, but if tags become more and more, the tag itself becomes poorly managed, so there is a way to manage the tag in a way. The application manages the tag using nested tags, the subtag can be created under the tag, and does not limit the number of nested layers . Through the nested tags, you can simulate the function of the hierarchical directory. Again, the application gives you the greatest flexibility, specifically how to use completely dependent on your imagination. When an entry is added with a tag, all of the parent tags are also implicitly added, which is why when you browse an entry under one entry, you can also browse to the entries under all sub-tags of the tag.
